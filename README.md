# MTools v1.0
My personal python library with numerous random classes and methods that I use as shortcuts. See below for details on what it contains.

### CLASSES
**``class Input_Box``**
 - A highly configurable text box class for implementation anywhere. Includes positioning, custom padding, and text returning.
 - Not fully tested yet

**``class Color``**
 - A class that allows you to access a lot of different RGB values that have names.
 - Example usage:
 - ``background_color = color.dark_grey``
